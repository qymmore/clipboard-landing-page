## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This mini project was a good memory refresher of CSS flexbox and learning how to use hover states for links. Additionally, I also learned how to ensure images in the landing page scale with the browser when re-sized. One of the main issues I faced was trying to adjust the hover state color for the social media icons in the page footer - but I decided to come back to that at a later time. 


### Continued development

A couple of things I'd like to learn and work-on for this project in the future:
- How to optimize the code for viewing the landing page on mobile devices (learning how to use media queries, etc.).
- How to change the hover state color for SVG icons/images.

### Feedback and suggestions
I'm open to any form of feedback or suggestions you might have. In particular, I'd like to have some feedback on how to tidy up the code and/or write code more efficiently. But all feedbacks & suggestions are welcome!
